# Periodic Tbales: Restaurant Reservation Application

## Introduction
Periodic Tables is a restaurant reservation booking and table management system. Users of this application can view, create, edit, and delete reservations. Users can also search for reservations via mobile-number. Users can create new tables and seat reservations at a specific table.

##Features
### Create Reservation
You can create a reservation in the next way. First you can create a new reservation by clicking on the `+ New Reservation` at the top of the page. Each reservation requires a first name, last name, mobile number, party size, reservation time, and reservation date.
> Errors will be thrown if one of the following were to occur: Invalid mobile number length, any of the fields are empty, date of reservation must be placed for the future, and the reservation time must be valid as well being between the restaurant operating hours.

To seat a reservation, simply click on the `Seat` button, this will redirect the user to a new page where the user can view the reservation party size. It will also display to the user a dropdown table which will list all of the tables and the table's max seating.
